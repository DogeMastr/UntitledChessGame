Show moves is wrong

needs to check from the selected tile not the first

split different for loops depending on what peice it is

Current:
	checking from 0
		good for pawns knights and kings
2:
	checking from selected
		should be good for bishop rook and queen

this would allow to check the rook & bishop if there is a tile blocking

new boolean blocking = false

if i = same team : dont highlight and blocking true
if i = different team: highlight and blocking true

if i = team -1: blocking = false

if blocking dont highlight



second for loop:
from selected down

rook
if same team:
	blocked true

if other team
	highlight
	blocked true

if blank
	if not blocked
		highlight

bishop
fuck
